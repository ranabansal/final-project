How important are Indian steel exports to the United States? How about Indian tea exports to Germany?

This final project for Gov 1005 provides information on India’s largest export partners and most exported commodities between 2014 and 2017. 

With this information, readers can identify which trade partners and commodities are most important for India. Users can also search for specific countries and specific commodity goods to see their importance to the export economy. 

India's largest export partners stayed relatively constant over the four year period: the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and China occupied the top four positions each year. Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom were also consistently among top export partners.

Additionally, my app provides information on India’s trade fraction of total South Asian exports at a granular level for a specific commodity, for instance a snapshot of Iron and Steel Exports over a four year period. With these tools, a user can see how India's export of this commodity grew in importance for countries around the globe on a monthly level.
