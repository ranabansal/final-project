How important are Indian steel exports to the United States? How about Indian tea exports to Germany?

This final project for Gov 1005 provides information on India’s largest export partners and most exported commodities between 2014 and 2017. 

With this information, readers can identify which trade partners and commodities are most important for India. Users can also search for specific countries and specific commodity goods to see their importance to the export economy. 

India's largest export partners stayed relatively constant over the four year period: the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and China occupied the top four positions each year. Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom were also consistently among top export partners.

Additionally, my app provides information on India’s trade fraction of total South Asian exports at a granular level for a specific commodity, for instance a snapshot of Iron and Steel Exports over the four year period. With these tools, a user can see how India's export of this commodity grew in importance for countries around the globe on a monthly level.

PS - This project was inspired by demonetization that occurred in November 2016 in India and had an impact on the export economy. The Government of India unexpectedly announced through a nationally televised briefing that all existing 500 and 1000 rupee notes, representing 86% of the value of currency in circulation, would become illegal tender as of midnight. Citizens had the opportunity to deposit these notes in certified banks until December 31, 2016, with certain limits and restrictions, at which time the notes lost their value entirely. The government announced production of new notes to replace the demonetized currency; however, printing presses nationally had limited capacity and it ultimately took one full year for large-note legal bills to return to the earlier level as a percentage of cash in the economy. This shock likely manifested in the export value of India after November 2016, and this project provides statistics to help with this analysis.
